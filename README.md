# ☕ Bright Coffee Sales Analysis

This repository contains a detailed sales analysis for a coffee shop chain with **three locations**, covering the period from **January to June 2023**.
The goal of this project is to understand revenue trends, customer preferences, and to provide meaningful insights that support informed business decisions.

This case study aims to identify **high-performing** and **low-performing** stores through **weekly** and **monthly** analysis.
It also examines products that sell the most during **peak** and **non-peak** hours. For products that do not perform as well, recommendations are provided to help improve sales.

## 📊 Insights

The insights presented are based on the sales analysis and focus on addressing performance gaps across the three coffee shops.

A key recommendation is for underperforming stores to:

* Offer **half-price promotions on Wednesdays** to attract more customers midweek.
* Introduce **student deals** on lower-selling items to increase product movement.

At the same time, the **top-performing (star) products** should be included in these deals to maintain customer interest and ensure they continue contributing strongly to revenue.

## 🔍 Findings
